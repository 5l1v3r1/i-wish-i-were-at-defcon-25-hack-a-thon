# The "I Wish I Were at DefCon 25" Hack-a-Thon

I thought this year would finally be the year I would make it out to [DefCon 25](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-25/dc-25-index.html).  Rats.

Well, okay.  The if the conference is four days (July 27-30, 2017) I bet I take that weekend off.  So I am going to throw my own Hack-a-Thon that weekend.  I will lock myself away from the world and experiment with all the InfoSec / penetration testing tools I can.


## Goals

> Try out a bunch of InfoSec and pentration tools. Build a Raspberry Pi web server using a LAMP stack and attack it. Start with Metasploit and Kali Linux.


## Logging the Hack-a-Thon

I will be logging all the progress and mistakes I make, as I go along.

* [Preparation](logs/early_prep.md) - Make a plan for the hack-a-thon, and collect what I will need.
* **[Friday Night](logs/friday.md)** - Short day, just after work.
* **[Saturday](logs/saturday.md)** - Full day.
* **[Sunday](logs/sunday.md)** - Full day.
* [Post-Mortem](logs/the_post_mortem.md) - What did I learn?
