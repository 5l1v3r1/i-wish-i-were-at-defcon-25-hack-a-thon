# My Own, Private "I Wish I Were at DefCon 25" Hack-a-Thon

I thought this year would finally be the year I would make it out to [DefCon 25](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-25/dc-25-index.html).  Rats.  Well, the conference is four days (July 27-30, 2017) and I have that weekend off, so I am going to have my own private Hack-a-Thon that weekend.  I will lock myself away and play with all the InfoSec / NetSec tools I can.  This Hack-a-Thon will be more about learning than building a single thing.


## Goals

> Build a Raspberry Pi server and a LAMP webpage, and use that to test out: the Slow Loris attack, and all the various penetration-testing tools I can find in Kali Linux and the Metasploit textbook.


## Logging the Hack-a-Thon

I will be logging all the progress and mistakes I make, as I go along.

* [Early Prep](logs/early_prep.md) - Make a plan for the hack-a-thon, and collect what I'll need.
* [Friday Night](logs/friday.md) - Short day, just after work.
* [Saturday](logs/saturday.md) - Full day.
* [Sunday](logs/sunday.md) - Full day.
