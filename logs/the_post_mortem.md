# The Hack-a-Thon Post-Mortem

> What did I learn?


## Open Source Projects

> It would be cool to contribute to an open source NetSec or pen testing project.

GitHub keeps a list of popular security projects [here](https://github.com/showcases/security?s=stars).

These projects are in languages I know well and might otherwise be a good place for me to start looking:

* [Metasploit Framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) - pen testing
* [MozDef](https://github.com/mozilla/MozDef) - Mozilla Defense Platform
* [GRR](https://github.com/google/grr/tree/gh-pages) - Google Rapid Response forensics and investigation
* [Cuckoo](https://github.com/cuckoosandbox/cuckoo) - sandbox for malware analysis


## Minutia

Less important things I learned.


#### Terminology

I finally sorted all of these out in my head.

* **InfoSec** - A very general term for keeping all kinds of information secure.
* **NetSec** - Usually more concerned with Firewalls, VPNs, IDPs, and router-level penetrations.
* **AppSec** - Related more to software design and practices.
* **ITSec** - Inside the system: host-based security, domain controllers / auth servers, access controls systems.
* **OpSec** - The physical end of security, including social engineering defense.
