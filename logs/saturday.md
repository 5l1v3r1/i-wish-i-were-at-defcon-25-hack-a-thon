# Saturday Hack-a-Thon Log


## 5 AM

Woke up, jazzercised, ate half a mellon.


## 9 AM - Wake, Have Coffee

Okay, I am awake for real this time. I have coffee.  And I'm ready to hit [Chapter 4](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter04/creatingtoolsdir.html).

And... most of my work from last night appears to have disappeared. Nothing is mounted and I can't find the damn `sources` directory.  Crap.


## 11:37 PM

Drunk.  Watching the news to see if I get caught.
