# Sunday Hack-a-Thon Log


## 5 AM

Woke up, jazzercised, ate half a mellon.


## 7 AM - Back at It

The GCC `make` succeeded.  Now for `make install` and to try Linux API headers again.


## 7:15 AM - glibc

Okay, I am trying glibc again. Which me luck.

I also just found out that (I think) I can do `make -j 4` and run the build in parallel.

1. I didn't know GCC allowed for parallel compiles!
2. This cheap little Raspberry Pi can run the glibc build in parallel!

Okay, I'm going for a run while this works.
